There are several transforms used in signal processing to analyze and represent signals in different domains. Here are some of the most commonly used transforms:

1. **Fourier Transform (FT):**
   - **Continuous-Time Fourier Transform (CTFT):** Analyzes signals in the frequency domain.
   - **Discrete-Time Fourier Transform (DTFT):** Similar to CTFT but applied to discrete-time signals.

2. **Laplace Transform:**
   - Used in continuous-time signal analysis, particularly in control systems and circuit analysis.

3. **Z-Transform:**
   - Applied to discrete-time signals and systems, commonly used in digital signal processing.

4. **Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT):**
   - Discretized version of the Fourier Transform, computed using algorithms like the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).

5. **Wavelet Transform:**
   - Used for time-frequency analysis and is well-suited for signals with non-stationary or localized features.
   - Includes Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT).

6. **Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT):**
   - Provides a compromise between time and frequency resolution by analyzing short segments of a signal.

7. **Hilbert Transform:**
   - Used to obtain the analytic signal, which encodes both amplitude and phase information.

8. **Mellin Transform:**
   - Generalization of the Laplace Transform and Fourier Transform, often used in image and pattern analysis.

9. **Radon Transform:**
   - Primarily used in medical imaging and tomography to reconstruct images from projections.

10. **Hough Transform:**
    - Used for feature extraction, particularly in image analysis, to detect patterns like lines or curves.

These transforms serve different purposes and are chosen based on the characteristics of the signal and the goals of analysis. The selection of a specific transform depends on factors such as signal type, application domain, and desired outcomes. Each transform provides a unique perspective for signal analysis, making it easier to extract meaningful information from signals in different contexts.
