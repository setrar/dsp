While it's not strictly necessary to fully understand Fourier series in order to use Fourier transform, having a basic understanding of Fourier series can provide valuable insights and context. Fourier series and Fourier transform are closely related concepts, and their understanding often complements each other.

Here's a brief overview:

1. **Fourier Series:**
   - Represents a periodic function as a sum of sine and cosine functions (or complex exponentials).
   - Applicable to periodic signals, which repeat over a certain interval.
   - Involves coefficients (Fourier coefficients) that determine the contribution of each harmonic frequency.

2. **Fourier Transform:**
   - Generalizes the concept of Fourier series to non-periodic signals and signals defined over the entire real line.
   - Represents a signal in the frequency domain by decomposing it into sinusoidal components.
   - Involves a continuous spectrum of frequencies rather than discrete harmonics.

Understanding Fourier series helps in grasping the idea that any periodic signal can be represented as a sum of sinusoidal components. This understanding is then extended to Fourier transform, which deals with non-periodic signals and provides a continuous representation of the frequency content.

In practice, when dealing with Fourier transform, you often encounter expressions like:

$$ X(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(t) \cdot e^{-i \omega t} \, dt $$

Having a conceptual understanding of how sinusoidal components contribute to a signal (as learned from Fourier series) can aid in interpreting and working with these expressions.

In summary, while it's possible to use Fourier transform without an in-depth understanding of Fourier series, learning about Fourier series can enhance your overall comprehension of signal processing and Fourier analysis.
