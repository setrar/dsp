 The Canadian government has announced it will licence 80 MHz of mid-band spectrum at 3900-3980 MHz for local shared and private 5G networks. It has also proposed to release portions of the mmWave bands at 26 GHz, 28 GHz, and 38 GHz for local usage by enterprises and other non-traditional users. The government said it will implement an automated licensing system from 2024.




Canada [(ISED)](https://www.ic.gc.ca/), in charge of the new licensing framework, said it wanted to `“help smaller users access 5G spectrum in very localized areas”`. 

It listed:
- `agriculture`,
- `mining`,
- `manufacturing`,
- `healthcare`,
- `public safety and transportation` as candidate industries

to set up:
- `private` and
- `campus` 5G networks with local spectrum.
