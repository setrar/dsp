> can I use the [CaribouLite - 6GHz SDR](https://github.com/cariboulabs/cariboulite) as a wifi

Yes, the CaribouLite - 6GHz SDR (Certified by [OSHWA](https://www.oshwa.org/)) can be used for Wi-Fi communication in the 6 GHz frequency range. The 6 GHz band has been designated for Wi-Fi use, and the CaribouLite SDR can operate within this frequency range to enable Wi-Fi connectivity.

With the CaribouLite SDR, you can configure it as an access point or a client to establish Wi-Fi connections with compatible devices. It supports various Wi-Fi protocols, including Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) and Wi-Fi 6E, which utilizes the 6 GHz band for enhanced performance and reduced interference.

However, it's important to note that the CaribouLite SDR is a hardware platform, and configuring it as a Wi-Fi access point or client would require appropriate software and firmware support. You would need to ensure that you have the necessary software stack and drivers compatible with Wi-Fi operation in the 6 GHz band.

Additionally, regulatory requirements and licenses may apply for operating in specific frequency bands, including the 6 GHz band. It's essential to understand and comply with the regulations and licensing requirements in your jurisdiction when using radio frequency devices.

To use the CaribouLite SDR as a Wi-Fi device, you may need to refer to the documentation, software tools, and firmware provided by the manufacturer to configure it for Wi-Fi operation and ensure compliance with applicable regulations.
