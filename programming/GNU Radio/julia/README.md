# Generate GNU Radio Julia Block

To generate a `CMakeLists.txt` file that integrates Julia packages into a C++ project, you'll need to ensure that your project is set up to link against the Julia runtime and include the necessary Julia headers. Below is a template for a `CMakeLists.txt` file that incorporates Julia:

### Example `CMakeLists.txt`

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.14)
project(MyJuliaProject)

# Set C++ standard
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

# Find Julia
find_package(Julia REQUIRED)

# Set the Julia library and include directories
set(JULIA_LIBRARY_DIR "${Julia_LIBRARY_DIR}")
set(JULIA_INCLUDE_DIRS "${Julia_INCLUDE_DIRS}")

# Include the Julia headers
include_directories(${JULIA_INCLUDE_DIRS})

# Define your source files
set(SOURCES
    src/main.cpp
    src/your_cpp_file.cpp
)

# Add executable
add_executable(${PROJECT_NAME} ${SOURCES})

# Link Julia library
target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} ${Julia_LIBRARY})

# Optionally, if using other libraries or packages:
# find_package(SomeOtherLibrary REQUIRED)
# target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} SomeOtherLibrary::SomeOtherLibrary)
```

### Explanation

- **`find_package(Julia REQUIRED)`**: This line searches for the Julia installation on your system using CMake's `FindJulia.cmake` module.
  
- **`set(JULIA_LIBRARY_DIR "${Julia_LIBRARY_DIR}")`**: This sets the Julia library directory. The variable `${Julia_LIBRARY_DIR}` should automatically be set by the `find_package` command if Julia is found correctly.

- **`include_directories(${JULIA_INCLUDE_DIRS})`**: This adds the Julia include directory to your project, allowing you to include Julia headers in your C++ files.

- **`target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} ${Julia_LIBRARY})`**: This links your executable with the Julia library, so your program can use the Julia runtime.

### Steps to Use

1. **Set Up Your Project Directory:**

   - Create a directory structure similar to:
     ```
     MyJuliaProject/
     ├── CMakeLists.txt
     ├── src/
     │   ├── main.cpp
     │   └── your_cpp_file.cpp
     └── include/
     ```

2. **Write Your C++ Code:**

   In your `src/main.cpp`, include the necessary Julia headers and write code that uses Julia functions. For example:

   ```cpp
   #include <julia.h>

   int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
       // Initialize Julia
       jl_init();

       // Example: Call a Julia function from C++
       jl_eval_string("println(\"Hello from Julia!\")");

       // Shutdown Julia
       jl_atexit_hook(0);
       return 0;
   }
   ```

3. **Configure and Build with CMake:**

   - Navigate to your project directory and run:
     ```bash
     mkdir build
     cd build
     cmake ..
     make
     ```

   - If everything is configured correctly, this will generate an executable that links with Julia and runs your C++ code.

### Summary

This `CMakeLists.txt` template provides a basic setup to integrate Julia into a C++ project using CMake. You can extend it to include additional libraries, handle more complex build configurations, or manage multiple source files as needed.
