Yes, GNU Radio has blocks written in languages other than Python. While Python is commonly used for scripting and creating custom blocks in GNU Radio, many of the core blocks are written in **C++** for performance reasons. Here's an overview of the different types of blocks and the languages used:

### 1. **C++ Blocks:**

- **Core Blocks**: Most of the core blocks in GNU Radio, including those for basic signal processing operations (e.g., filters, FFTs, modulators, demodulators), are implemented in C++. C++ is used because it offers high performance, which is critical for real-time signal processing tasks.
  
- **Custom Blocks**: Advanced users can also write custom blocks in C++ when they need the highest performance possible. These blocks are then compiled and integrated into GNU Radio using the GNU Radio Companion (GRC) or directly in C++-based flowgraphs.

### 2. **Python-Wrapped C++ Blocks:**

- **SWIG Interface**: GNU Radio uses SWIG (Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator) to create Python bindings for its C++ blocks. This allows users to access and use C++ blocks within Python scripts and GNU Radio Companion (GRC) flowgraphs while still benefiting from the performance of C++.

- **Hybrid Approach**: Many GNU Radio blocks are written in C++ for performance but are wrapped with Python bindings. This allows users to interact with these blocks in Python or GRC without needing to delve into C++ code directly.

### 3. **Python Blocks:**

- **Pure Python Blocks**: Users can also create blocks entirely in Python, which is convenient for rapid prototyping, testing, and educational purposes. These blocks are generally easier to write and debug but may not perform as well as their C++ counterparts, especially in high-throughput or real-time applications.

- **GNU Radio Companion (GRC)**: GRC is a graphical tool that allows users to design signal processing flowgraphs by connecting blocks. While many of the blocks in GRC are backed by C++ implementations, the flowgraphs themselves are typically written in Python.

### 4. **Other Languages and Interfacing:**

- **Embedded Languages**: GNU Radio can interface with other languages and tools through various mechanisms, such as using foreign function interfaces (FFI), RPC (remote procedure call) mechanisms, or through middleware. This allows the integration of blocks or functions written in languages like Julia, as previously mentioned, or even MATLAB, Octave, or other environments.

- **Block Interfacing**: Through Python or C++ code, GNU Radio can be extended to use code or libraries written in other languages, making it highly flexible. For example:
  - **Calling MATLAB/Octave**: Users can call MATLAB/Octave scripts from within GNU Radio to leverage specific DSP capabilities.
  - **Using External Libraries**: Libraries written in languages like Fortran (often used in numerical computation) or Rust (known for safety and concurrency) can be interfaced with GNU Radio.

### 5. **Using External Tools:**

- **Interfacing with SDR Hardware**: Many SDR hardware drivers are written in languages other than Python, such as C or C++, but are wrapped to be used within GNU Radio. Examples include UHD (USRP Hardware Driver) and various drivers for other SDR platforms (e.g., LimeSDR, RTL-SDR).

### Summary:

- **C++**: The majority of GNU Radioâ€™s core blocks are implemented in C++ for performance.
- **Python**: Many blocks are accessible via Python, either through direct implementation or via bindings for C++ code. Custom blocks can also be created in Python.
- **Other Languages**: GNU Radio can interface with and utilize code written in other languages, such as Julia, MATLAB, or Rust, providing a flexible environment for signal processing.

This multi-language support allows GNU Radio to balance between ease of use (Python) and performance (C++), making it a versatile tool for both rapid development and high-performance applications in signal processing.
