- [ ] Question :one:

An IV administers medication to a patient's bloodstream at a rate of 3 cubic centimeters per hour.
At the same time, the patient's organs remove the medication from the patient's bloodstream at a rate proportional to the current volume V of medication in the bloodstream.

> Which equation describes this relationship?

```math
\begin{gather}
  \\ \frac{\mathit{dV}}{\mathit{dt}} = 3 - kV \\
  \\


\end{gather}
```
