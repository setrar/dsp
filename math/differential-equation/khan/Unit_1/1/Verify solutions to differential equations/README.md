```math

\begin{gather}
   \\
   \frac{\mathit{dy}}{\mathit{dx}} = \frac{5y}{x} \\
   \\
   \text{ Is } y = −2x^5 \text{ a solution to the above equation? }
   \\
\end{gather}

```

```math
\begin{gather}
\text { In order to find whether } y = −2x^5 \text{ is a solution, }\\
\text { we need to substitute it into the equation } \\
\text { and see if we get equivalent expressions on each side of the equal sign. }
\\
\end{gather}
```

```math
\begin{gather}
\frac{\mathit{d}}{\mathit{dx}} \big[ −2x^5 \big]
\end{gather}
