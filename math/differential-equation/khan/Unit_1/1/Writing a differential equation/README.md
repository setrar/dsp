\color{White} \text{ A particle moves along a straight line. Its {\color{Cerulean}speed} is inversely proportional to the square of the distance, S, it has traveled }. \\
\\
S = distance, \\
\color{Cerulean} \frac{\mathit{dS}}{\mathit{dt}} = Speed \\
\\
\color{Orange} \text{ Solution: } \\
\\
\frac{\mathit{dS}}{\mathit{dt}} = \frac{k}{S^2}
