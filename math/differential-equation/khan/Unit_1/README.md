# [Unit 1: First order differential equations](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/differential-equations/first-order-differential-equations)

About this unit
Differential equations relate a function to its derivative. That means the solution set is one or more functions, not a value or set of values. Lots of phenomena change based on their current value, including population sizes, the balance remaining on a loan, and the temperature of a cooling object.
