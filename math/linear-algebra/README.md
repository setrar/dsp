:abacus: [Linear Algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra)


Linear algebra is the branch of mathematics concerning [linear equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_equation) such as:

```math
 a_1x_1 + \dots + a_nx_n = b
```
linear maps such as:

```math
 (x_{1},\dots ,x_{n}) \to a_{1}x_{1}+\cdots +a_{n}x_{n},
```
and their representations in [vector spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space) and through [matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)).
