:cat:GPT what is the difference between svd and eigen value decomposition?

SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) and Eigenvalue Decomposition (EVD) are two different matrix factorization techniques used in linear algebra and numerical computing. They serve distinct purposes and have different applications:

1. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD):
SVD is a factorization method that decomposes a rectangular matrix (not necessarily square) into three matrices. For an m × n matrix A with real or complex elements, SVD provides the following factorization:

A = UΣV*

where:
- U is an m × m orthogonal matrix (U*U = I, where U* is the conjugate transpose of U).
- Σ is an m × n diagonal matrix with non-negative real numbers on the diagonal. The elements on the diagonal are known as the singular values of A.
- V* is the conjugate transpose of an n × n orthogonal matrix V (V*V = I).

SVD has broad applications in various fields, including numerical linear algebra, signal processing, data compression, and machine learning (e.g., Principal Component Analysis).

2. Eigenvalue Decomposition (EVD):
EVD is a factorization method applicable only to square matrices. It decomposes a square matrix A into three matrices:

A = VΛV^(-1)

where:
- V is an n × n matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of A. These eigenvectors are linearly independent.
- Λ is an n × n diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues of A.

EVD is used to analyze the behavior of linear transformations represented by square matrices and is widely used in various applications, including differential equations, stability analysis of dynamical systems, and quantum mechanics.

Differences between SVD and EVD:

1. Applicability: SVD can be applied to both rectangular and square matrices, while EVD is only applicable to square matrices.

2. Output: In SVD, you get three matrices (U, Σ, and V*), whereas EVD provides two matrices (V and Λ).

3. Diagonalization: In EVD, the diagonal matrix Λ contains the eigenvalues, which may be real or complex. In SVD, the singular values are always non-negative real numbers, and they appear in the diagonal matrix Σ.

4. Orthogonality: Both U and V in SVD are orthogonal matrices (or unitary matrices for complex matrices). In EVD, V contains the eigenvectors, which are not necessarily orthogonal unless the matrix A is symmetric.

In summary, SVD and EVD are both powerful matrix factorization techniques, but they are used for different types of matrices and serve different purposes in linear algebra and various fields of application. SVD is more general and versatile, whereas EVD is specific to square matrices and primarily used for eigenvalue analysis.
