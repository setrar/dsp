# Flashing the board

To initialize a **HackRF One** board, flashing the FPGA and firmware ensures the device is running the latest software and is ready for operation. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

### **Step 1: Download the Latest Firmware and FPGA Bitstream**
Get the latest firmware and FPGA files from the [official HackRF GitHub releases page](https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/hackrf/releases).

- Firmware: `hackrf_one_usb.bin`
- FPGA Bitstream: `hackrf_one_fpga.bit`

Save these files to a convenient directory on your computer.

For example: 

- [ ] Download

```bash
wget https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/hackrf/releases/download/v2024.02.1/hackrf-2024.02.1.zip
```

- [ ] Uncompress

```bash
unzip hackrf-2024.02.1.zip
```

### **Step 2: Flash the Firmware**
Flashing the firmware updates the device's internal memory with the latest control logic.

#### **Steps:**
1. Put the HackRF in DFU (Device Firmware Upgrade) mode:
   - Press and hold the **DFU** button on the HackRF.
   - Connect the HackRF to your computer via USB while holding the button.
   - Release the button after a few seconds.

2. Use the `hackrf_spiflash` tool to write the firmware:
   ```bash
   hackrf_spiflash --write hackrf-2024.02.1/firmware-bin/hackrf_one_usb.bin
   ```
   > Returns
   ```powershell
   File size 42248 bytes.

   Writing 42248 bytes at 0x000000.
   ```
   
3. Reboot the device:
   - Unplug the HackRF from the USB port and plug it back in.

4. Test the device:

   ```bash
   hackrf_info
   ```
   > Returns
   ```powershell
   hackrf_info version: 2024.02.1
   libhackrf version: 2024.02.1 (0.9)
   Found HackRF
   Index: 0
   Serial number: 000000000000000078d063dc2c657323
   Board ID Number: 4 (HackRF One)
   Firmware Version: n_240227 (API:1.08)
   Part ID Number: 0xa000cb3c 0x004f475d
   Hardware Revision: r9
   Hardware does not appear to have been manufactured by Great Scott Gadgets.
   Hardware supported by installed firmware:
       HackRF One
   ```

### **Step 3: Flash the FPGA Bitstream**
The FPGA bitstream configures the onboard FPGA to function as intended.

#### **Steps:**
1. Use the `hackrf_cpldjtag` tool to flash the FPGA:
   ```bash
   hackrf_cpldjtag -x hackrf_one_fpga.bit
   ```

2. Verify the FPGA update by checking the firmware version:
   ```bash
   hackrf_info
   ```

   The output should indicate the FPGA version.

---

### **Step 4: Test the Initialization**
Run the following command to ensure the HackRF is working:
```bash
hackrf_info
```
Expected output:
- Board ID: HackRF One
- Firmware Version: (e.g., 2023.x.x)
- Part ID Number and Serial Number should be populated.

---

### Troubleshooting
1. **Device Not Recognized:**
   - Ensure the USB drivers are correctly installed (e.g., use Zadig on Windows to install WinUSB for HackRF).
   - Use a different USB port or cable.

2. **DFU Mode Not Detected:**
   - Ensure you press the DFU button before connecting the HackRF to USB.

3. **Permission Issues (Linux):**
   - Add udev rules for non-root access:
     ```bash
     sudo bash -c 'echo "SUBSYSTEM==\"usb\", ATTR{idVendor}==\"1d50\", ATTR{idProduct}==\"6089\", MODE=\"0666\"" > /etc/udev/rules.d/52-hackrf.rules'
     sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
     ```

## FPGA bitstream 

---

### **Step 1: Download the Full Source Repository**
If you can't find the bitstream in the release package, it might be part of the repository's source code.

1. Clone the HackRF repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/hackrf.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the `firmware-bin` directory:
   ```bash
   cd hackrf/firmware-bin
   ```
3. Look for the `hackrf_one_fpga.bit` file:
   ```bash
   ls -lh
   ```

---

### **Step 2: Build the FPGA Bitstream (Optional)**
If the `hackrf_one_fpga.bit` file is not included, you can build it yourself using the Xilinx ISE toolchain:

1. Install the Xilinx ISE toolchain (requires a licensed version).
2. Navigate to the FPGA source files in the repository:
   ```bash
   cd hackrf/fpga
   ```
3. Build the FPGA bitstream:
   ```bash
   make
   ```
   The `hackrf_one_fpga.bit` file will be generated in the build output directory.

### **Alternative Links**
If the bitstream is missing from GitHub, you can try downloading it from other mirrors or repositories (e.g., community-maintained resources). I recommend double-checking the release package contents you downloaded, as the bitstream is usually included there.
