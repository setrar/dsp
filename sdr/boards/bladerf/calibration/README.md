#### No gain calibration tables found for this serial number

The message “No gain calibration tables found for this serial number” means that there are no pre-calibrated gain values associated with your specific bladeRF device (with serial number b1f3da6672d54d37a2cd7c4d3e3c2e25) in Nuand’s database.

Calibration tables are used to correct for variances in RF performance (e.g., gain, frequency response) that can arise due to hardware tolerances. These tables ensure consistent performance across devices by compensating for unique characteristics of each unit.

Next Steps

	1.	Check the Nuand Product Service Page:
	•	Visit Nuand’s bladeRF calibration service page for instructions on how to obtain or request calibration tables for your device. They might provide a way to download, generate, or order calibration tables for specific serial numbers.
	2.	Run Manual Calibration (if available):
	•	Some bladeRF devices support manual calibration through the bladeRF-cli interface, allowing you to create custom calibration settings, though this process can be complex and require test equipment.
	3.	Contact Nuand Support:
	•	If your device requires calibration for specific applications, contacting Nuand for further guidance or to request calibration services may be helpful.

Having calibration tables is especially important for applications where precise RF performance is critical, such as communications or sensitive measurements.
