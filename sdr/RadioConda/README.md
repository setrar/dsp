   - Uses the **Conda** ecosystem (Anaconda/Miniconda) to manage dependencies, libraries, and tools.

3. **Support for Popular SDR Tools**:
   - Includes tools like:
     - **GNU Radio** (a signal processing framework)
     - **GQRX** (SDR receiver)
     - **SoapySDR** (SDR abstraction layer)
     - **BladeRF**, **HackRF**, and **RTL-SDR** drivers

4. **Cross-Platform**:
   - Works on **Linux**, **macOS**, and **Windows**.

5. **Python Integration**:
   - Provides Python libraries to interface with SDR hardware and process signals.
