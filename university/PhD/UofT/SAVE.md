# PhD Proposal Session Notes

## Summary
This document outlines a discussion on pursuing a joint PhD between the **University of Toronto (UofT)** and **EURECOM**, focusing on the development of an **Open-Source 5G Radio Unit (RU)**. The project aims to leverage **FPGAs** and eCPRI interfaces, with Professor **Stephen Brown** as a potential supervisor.

## Key Points
- **University of Toronto**: Discussion around research expertise at UofT, especially within the **ECE** department under **Professor Brown**, focusing on **FPGA architecture** and **CAD tools**.
- **EURECOM**: A potential partner for the joint PhD, offering expertise in **telecommunications** and **5G/6G** development.
- **Research Proposal**: Developing an open-source 5G RU using FPGAs, with a focus on eCPRI and next-generation network solutions.

## Proposal Outline
### Introduction
The project proposes the development of an **open-source 5G Radio Unit** using **FPGA technology**. This will address growing industry needs for flexible, reconfigurable, and cost-effective solutions in 5G and beyond. By leveraging eCPRI interfaces, the RU can integrate into existing network infrastructure more efficiently.

### Research Idea
- Develop a modular, open-source design for a 5G Radio Unit (RU).
- Utilize **FPGAs** to enable reconfigurability and adaptability for future standards (e.g., **6G**).
- Focus on integrating **eCPRI interfaces** for efficient communication between the RU and the network core.

### Supervisor and Collaboration
- **Professor Stephen Brown** at UofT: Expertise in FPGA architecture, hardware design, and open-source projects.
- **EURECOM**: Collaboration to leverage their telecommunications research and 5G/6G advancements.

### Conclusion
This project has the potential to significantly impact the field of telecommunications by providing an open-source alternative for RUs, enabling greater innovation in the industry.

## Next Steps
- **Contact Professor Brown**: Initiate discussions regarding potential supervision and joint collaboration with **EURECOM**.
- **Refine Proposal**: Incorporate feedback from both UofT and EURECOM to align with their research priorities.
