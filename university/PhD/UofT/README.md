## Detailed Chat Log

### Question: What is a flipped classroom approach?
**Response**: 
A flipped classroom approach involves delivering instructional content, often online, outside of the classroom, and using class time for interactive exercises, problem-solving, or discussions. This method encourages students to learn independently before class and apply knowledge during in-class activities.

### Question: Is it worth doing a PhD on making a 5G, 6G radio unit open source?
**Response**: 
Yes, a PhD focusing on making a 5G or 6G Radio Unit (RU) open source can be highly relevant. Open-source solutions are gaining momentum, especially in the telecom industry, due to their flexibility and lower cost. However, challenges related to **hardware development** and the **proprietary nature** of certain telecom technologies should be considered.

### Question: What about Professor Stephen Brown at UofT?
**Response**: 
Professor **Stephen Brown** is a potential fit for supervising a PhD focused on FPGA-based systems and digital hardware, as his expertise lies in FPGA architecture, CAD algorithms, and hardware design. He’s also a co-author of textbooks on **digital logic** and **VHDL/Verilog**, which are key tools for FPGA design.
