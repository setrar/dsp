## Is it worth doing a PhD on making a 5G, 6G radio unit open source?

Pursuing a PhD on making a 5G or 6G radio unit open-source can be a highly impactful and valuable endeavor, but whether it is "worth it" depends on several factors related to your goals, the potential impact of the research, and the current state of technology:

### **Why It Might Be Worth It:**

1. **Relevance and Timeliness**: 
   - 5G is still in a growth phase, and 6G is emerging as a key area of future development. Research focused on democratizing access to these technologies could be highly relevant in the near and long term.
   
2. **Open-Source Movement**:
   - Open-source solutions have driven innovation in many fields (e.g., Linux, GNU Radio), and applying that to cellular technology could lower barriers for research, development, and smaller companies. Open-source 5G/6G radio units could accelerate advancements and democratize access to telecom infrastructure.
   
3. **Cutting-Edge Research**: 
   - Researching how to create an open-source radio unit for advanced wireless technologies like 5G or 6G would place you at the frontier of telecom, software-defined radio, and digital communication systems.
   
4. **Real-World Impact**:
   - Open-source hardware and software for 5G/6G can facilitate innovation, especially in underserved or developing regions where proprietary telecom solutions are cost-prohibitive.
   - It could also benefit research and education by providing a flexible and accessible platform for experimenting with next-gen communication technologies.

5. **Cross-Disciplinary Opportunities**:
   - This type of research spans multiple disciplines—software, hardware, signal processing, and even policy (regulatory aspects of spectrum usage). You can contribute to multiple fields and develop a unique skill set.

### **Challenges to Consider:**

1. **Complexity**:
   - Developing a fully functional 5G or 6G radio unit, particularly one that is open-source, is an enormous challenge. It involves hardware design, software for baseband processing, spectrum management, and more. The research would need to tackle very technical problems like waveform design, massive MIMO, beamforming, and power efficiency.
   
2. **Intellectual Property (IP)**:
   - 5G and 6G technologies are often locked behind patents held by major telecom companies. You may face legal and technical hurdles in ensuring your open-source designs do not infringe on existing IP.

3. **Commercial Viability**:
   - Open-source projects often face challenges when competing with established commercial solutions that are highly optimized and well-supported. Ensuring the open-source unit is practical and scalable for real-world deployment could be difficult.

4. **Funding**:
   - Securing funding for research on open-source telecom infrastructure might be harder than more commercially driven topics. However, there is growing interest from government agencies and tech companies supporting open-source initiatives.

### Potential Impact:
- **Academic Impact**: A PhD in this area would make you a leader in both the academic and practical development of next-generation communication technologies.
- **Industry Impact**: Telecom companies, startups, and developers could benefit from your contributions to open-source 5G/6G, and you could potentially create a foundational technology platform that transforms the industry.

### Conclusion:
If you're passionate about telecommunications, open-source software, and democratizing access to cutting-edge technology, this could be a highly fulfilling PhD topic. It offers potential for significant academic contributions and societal impact, but it will require careful navigation of technical, legal, and commercial challenges.


## Funding

using this [webpage](https://www.mie.utoronto.ca/programs/graduate/Scholarships-funding) how much funding in total a PhD student can achieve?

For a PhD student at the University of Toronto’s Department of Mechanical & Industrial Engineering (MIE), several funding options are available, which can be combined to achieve a significant total amount:

1. **Graduate Fellowships**: All PhD students in MIE receive a baseline fellowship, which provides around $26,000 per year. 

2. **Scholarships**: Students can apply for various scholarships, such as the **Ontario Graduate Scholarship (OGS)** or the **NSERC Postgraduate Scholarships**. The OGS provides $15,000 per year, while the NSERC awards can be even higher, depending on the specific scholarship.

3. **Top-Up Funding**: Students who receive external awards like the OGS or NSERC might also receive top-up funding from the university, which can add several thousand dollars to their annual support.

4. **Research and Teaching Assistantships**: These positions can provide additional income, often around $10,000 to $15,000 per year.

By combining these sources, a PhD student could potentially receive around $45,000 to $50,000 or more per year, depending on their success in obtaining scholarships and additional funding.
