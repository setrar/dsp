# PhD Funding

using this [webpage](https://www.mie.utoronto.ca/programs/graduate/Scholarships-funding) how much funding in total a PhD student can achieve?

For a PhD student at the University of Torontoâ€™s Department of Mechanical & Industrial Engineering (MIE), several funding options are available, which can be combined to achieve a significant total amount:

1. **Graduate Fellowships**: All PhD students in MIE receive a baseline fellowship, which provides around $26,000 per year. 

2. **Scholarships**: Students can apply for various scholarships, such as the **Ontario Graduate Scholarship (OGS)** or the **NSERC Postgraduate Scholarships**. The OGS provides $15,000 per year, while the NSERC awards can be even higher, depending on the specific scholarship.

3. **Top-Up Funding**: Students who receive external awards like the OGS or NSERC might also receive top-up funding from the university, which can add several thousand dollars to their annual support.

4. **Research and Teaching Assistantships**: These positions can provide additional income, often around $10,000 to $15,000 per year.

By combining these sources, a PhD student could potentially receive around $45,000 to $50,000 or more per year, depending on their success in obtaining scholarships and additional funding.
